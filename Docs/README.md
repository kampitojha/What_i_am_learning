# What I Am Learning

A small journal of my coding journey.

## What Is This Repo For?

Basically, this repo is my personal learning space where I document everything new I'm learning in my dev journey. Whether it's a backend concept I understood, a new frontend trick I learned, or any random tech thing that I found interesting - everything gets posted here.

This repo is just a living document that will grow with me. Sometimes messy, sometimes organized, but always real.

## What Will You Find Here?

- Backend Concepts - Server-side magic, databases, APIs, and everything backend related
- Frontend Development - UI/UX, frameworks, styling, animations and the frontend world
- Random Learnings - Whatever new things I learn that seem interesting

## What's The Purpose?

1. Track my learning - So I don't forget what I learned tomorrow
2. For reference - When I need to check something later
3. Track growth - To see how far I'm progressing
4. Share knowledge - If it helps someone else, that's a bonus

## Journey

This journey has just started and will be continuously updated. I'll keep adding concepts, code snippets, best practices, common mistakes, and my personal notes.

Note: This is a personal repo, so explanations might be casual because that's how I understand things best.

## Philosophy

> "Whatever you learn, document it. Your future self will thank you!"

The best way to learn coding is - build, break, learn, document, repeat!
